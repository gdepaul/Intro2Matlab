function [] = lecture4()

%% Lecture 4 - Matlab can perform repeated tasks and mathematical calculations
%%              which means we can sit back and relax. This is done using 
%%              loop structures. 

    disp('1. Calculate the mean and sum of all numbers within a matrix ')

    disp('2. Given a value n, calculate \sum_{i = 1}^n i^5'.)
 

    disp('3. Given a square matrix, determine if its a magic square (all of the rows, columns, and diagonals add up to the same number) ')

    disp('4. You have 100 doors and a person steps out of each door. They then close the door behind them, while opening every closed door and closing every open door after the door they exited. What are the closed doors after everyone has finished opening and closing doors.')
